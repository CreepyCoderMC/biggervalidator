# Bigger Validator
This module is small but easy to use. The purpose of this module is to check if the source value is bigger than the target value, and optionally also if they are equal. The source and target can be a string or a number.
## Validation Processes
The code checks that the source value is bigger than the target value, and optionally also if they are equal.
### Compare method 1
This method checks that the source value is bigger than the target value.
### Compare method 2
This method checks that the source value is equal to the value if specified.
## Code Sample
This following code is to tested that all methods correctly functions as intended, is also provided in this module.
```
const valueIsBigger = require('valueIsBigger')

console.log( "Testing Condition  1 Passed = " + valueIsBigger(  15  , 14            ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  2 Passed = " + valueIsBigger(  'b' , 'a'           ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  3 Passed = " + !valueIsBigger( 14  , 15            ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  4 Passed = " + !valueIsBigger( 'a' , 'b'           ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  5 Passed = " + !valueIsBigger( 15  , 15    , false ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  6 Passed = " + !valueIsBigger( 'a' , 'a'   , false ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  7 Passed = " + valueIsBigger(  15  , 15    , true  ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  8 Passed = " + valueIsBigger(  'a' , 'a'   , true  ) );
```
The results will look as follows
```
Testing Condition  1 Passed = true
Testing Condition  2 Passed = true
Testing Condition  3 Passed = true
Testing Condition  4 Passed = true
Testing Condition  5 Passed = true
Testing Condition  6 Passed = true
Testing Condition  7 Passed = true
Testing Condition  8 Passed = true
```

```
@param  { String , Number } source        The source value to compare
@param  { String , Number } target        The target value to compare
@param  { Boolean         } equal         Check if source value and target value equal ( optional , default = false )
